Based on this structure, it looks like your project is divided into several parts, including a frontend, contracts, and subgraph components. Here are the node modules typically required for each section and corresponding commands to install them.

### 1. *Global Dependencies*
   Install globally used tools if not already installed:

   bash
   npm install -g graph-cli
   

### 2. **Frontend (frontend) Dependencies**
   Navigate to the frontend directory and install the following dependencies:

   bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   

   Based on the typical frontend structure, here are common dependencies:

   bash
   npm install react react-dom 
   npm install ethers
   npm install axios
   npm install tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
   npm install dotenv
   

### 3. **Subgraph (subgraph) Dependencies**
   Navigate to the subgraph directory and install The Graph-related dependencies:

   bash
   cd ../subgraph
   npm install
   

   Additional subgraph-related dependencies could include:

   bash
   npm install @graphprotocol/graph-cli @graphprotocol/graph-ts
   npm install dotenv
   

### 4. **Backend/Contracts (contracts) Dependencies**
   For Solidity development, navigate to the contracts directory:

   bash
   cd ../contracts
   npm init -y
   npm install ethers hardhat
   

### 5. **Graphite/Graphite Development Environment (graphite)**
   In the graphite directory, you might need TypeScript and other Graph-related packages:

   bash
   cd ../graphite
   npm install
   

   Specific dependencies for graphite might include:

   bash
   npm install typescript ts-node
   npm install @graphprotocol/graph-cli @graphprotocol/graph-ts
   npm install dotenv
   

Each sub-directory with a package.json file will require running npm install to install its respective dependencies. This approach should set up your modules based on your project structure.
